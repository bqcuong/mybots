# MyBots

A list of my Telegram bots for my daily purposes.

## General Setup (Linux)
The bots require Python 3.7+ for running and Pip 20+. You can download and install Python3 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and Pip from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
Then you can create a virtual environment and install the dependencies if you do not want them to exist as your machine's system files, 
otherwise, you can ignore this step.

First, clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bqcuong/mybots.git /opt/mybots
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```
$ cd /opt/mybots
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Bot Installation & Usage
Check the sample installation and usage for Mofabot [here](mofabot/README.md).
The procedures for other bots require similar steps.
